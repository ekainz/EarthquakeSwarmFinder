```bash
GeoJSON Handler ==> Check for new entries ==> check if any new entries are within distance ==> send discord message
                ==> check if any entries have been updated ==> update discord message


Strech goals:
Discord command handler ==> /channel ==> update channel to send to
                        ==> /location (add/rm) ==> update distance(s) and location(s) for server

Discord Guild added ==> handle that somehow
```
